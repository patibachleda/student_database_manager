# Student Data Base Manager | Patrycja Bachleda

### GUIS:
    main_ui.py: holds the code for the main GUI that displays three buttons
    add_student.py: holds the code for the GUI to add students to db
    id_search.py: holds the code for the GUI to search students by ID
    name_search: holds the code for the GUI to search students by name
    
### CLASSES: 
    db_manager.py: holds the db object
    student_account.py: holds student account object
    
    
#### Database is included, not sure if it needs to be or not since the code creates it anyways.

#### TO RUN: to run the program run the main_ui.py file which has a main() function that runs the whole code.
